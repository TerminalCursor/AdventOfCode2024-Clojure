# Advent of Code
Language: Clojure

This is my first time using clojure. I have familiarity with elisp and a tiny bit of guile so this is going to be a challenge to myself. While I prefer Assembly (or C at the least), I wanted to try out a functional programming approach... and I didn't have my assembly library up to snuff for the challenge this year.
