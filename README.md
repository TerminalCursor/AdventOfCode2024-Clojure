# Advent of Code
Language: Clojure

This is my first time using clojure. I have familiarity with elisp and a tiny bit of guile so this is going to be a challenge to myself. While I prefer Assembly (or C at the least), I wanted to try out a functional programming approach... and I didn't have my assembly library up to snuff for the challenge this year.

I am structuring the folders by day. In each folder, I have a DXXP0T for the test part, DXXP01 for the first part, and DXXP02 for the second part.
